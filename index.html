                <p>The Moon is Earth's satellite, orbiting around our planet.
                    <br><br>
                    The moon is approximately 384,400 kilometers away from Earth.
                    <br><br>
                    The Moon has a diameter of about 3,474 kilometers, which is about a quarter of the size of Earth. Its gravity is about one-sixth of Earth's gravity.
                    <br><br>
                    The Moon is composed of rock and metal, with a surface covered in a layer of dust and rocky debris called regolith.
                     <br><br>
                    The Moon's surface is covered in impact craters formed by collisions with asteroids and other objects. The largest of these is the South Pole-Aitken basin, which is about 2,500 kilometers in diameter.
                    <br><br>
                    The Moon experiences temperature variations. During the day, temperatures can reach up to 127 degrees Celsius, while during the night, temperatures can drop as low as -173 degrees Celsius.

                    <p>The first successful mission to the Moon was Apollo 11 in July 1969. It had a crew of three: Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins. Armstrong and Aldrin were the astronauts who landed on the Moon's surface.</p>

                    <p>On July 20, 1969, Neil Armstrong became the first person to set foot on the Moon. His famous words, "That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind," echoed throughout history. Buzz Aldrin joined Armstrong on the moon's surface.</p>

                    The Moon showcases a captivating cycle of phases. It starts with the New Moon, when it is positioned between the Earth and the Sun, rendering it invisible. Shortly after sunset, the Waxing Crescent phase begins, revealing a slender sliver of the Moon in the sky.
                    <br><br>
                    As time progresses, the Moon enters the First Quarter, or Half Moon, phase. During this phase, the right half of the Moon becomes visible in the evening sky, resembling a half-circle. Moving forward, the Waxing Gibbous phase follows, displaying more than half of the Moon's surface each night and gradually appearing larger.
                    <br><br>
                    Reaching its peak, the Moon transitions into the Full Moon phase. Here, the entire face of the Moon is illuminated and visible from Earth, presenting a mesmerizing complete circle in the night sky. Subsequently, the Moon enters the waning phases, starting with the Waning Gibbous phase, where its visibility diminishes slightly each night. The cycle continues with the Third Quarter, or Half Moon, phase, revealing the left half of the Moon in the morning sky. Finally, the Moon enters the Waning Crescent phase, where a small crescent shape is visible before sunrise, marking the end of the cycle.
